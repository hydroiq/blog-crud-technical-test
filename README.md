## Laravel Developer Technical Test

### Task Description

Your task is to create a RESTful API for a simple blog system using Laravel. The API should allow users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. Additionally, the API should have endpoints for retrieving lists of posts, as well as for adding and removing tags from posts. The API should have the following features:

- User authentication using JWT or Laravel Sanctum.
- CRUD endpoints for blog posts.
- An endpoint to retrieve a list of all posts, including the post's title, body, author, and tags.
- An endpoint to add tags to a post.
- An endpoint to remove tags from a post.

You can use any front-end framework of your choice (or no framework at all). The API should be built using Laravel and should conform to RESTful API best practices.

### Requirements

1. The API should be built using Laravel 8 and PHP 7.4 or higher.
2. The database should be MySQL.
3. The API should use JWT or Laravel Sanctum for user authentication.
4. The API should use Laravel Eloquent ORM for interacting with the database.
5. The code should be organized into Controllers, Models, and Views.
6. The API should be fully tested using PHPUnit.
7. The API should conform to RESTful API best practices.

### Evaluation Criteria

You will be evaluated on the following criteria:

1. Code quality: Is the code well-organized, readable, and easy to follow?
2. Laravel knowledge: Does the applicant demonstrate a good understanding of Laravel and its built-in features, such as authentication and Eloquent ORM?
3. Database design: Is the database well-designed and efficient?
4. Testing: Are there unit tests covering the key functionality of the API?
5. RESTful API design: Does the API conform to RESTful API best practices, such as using appropriate HTTP verbs, returning appropriate status codes, and using appropriate response formats?
6. Security: Does the API handle user authentication and authorization correctly?
7. Documentation: Is the API well-documented and easy to use?

### Submission Instructions

1. Fork this GitHub repository and commit your code to your fork.
2. Include a README file with instructions on how to set up and use the API.
3. Send a link to your repository to the person who assigned you the test.
